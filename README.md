My Flask Application
This is a Flask web application that provides user registration, login, file uploading, and viewing public information. The application uses a MySQL database for storing user information and a local folder for storing uploaded files.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later installed
MySQL Server installed and running
Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
Setup
Clone the repository or download the source code.

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Application
Start the Flask application:
flask run 
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.

You should now see the home page of the Flask application. You can register, log in, upload files, and view public information.
You can only view the protected information once you are logged in
